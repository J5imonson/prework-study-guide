# Prework Study Guide

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I need a resource to help me study and keep track of the information given in class. To accomplish this, I set out to build a website to use as a reference and repository for all of this information. This website solves both of these problems.

I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript,and Git. I have recorded my notes within.
